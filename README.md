Considering an oriented graph. The aim is to find the maximal flow between a start nodes and terminal node subject to flow restrictions (input flow = output flow).
1)Formulate the problem as an integer programming problem
2)Implement the formulation in Java using CPLEX library
3)For each instance measure the running time as well as the optimal value
4)
