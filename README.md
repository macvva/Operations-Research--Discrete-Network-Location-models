# Operations-Research--Discrete-Network-Location-models
Considering an oriented graph. The aim is to find the maximal flow between a start nodesandterminal nodetsubject to flow restrictions (input flow = output flow) at all nodes butsandt. Foryour assignment, you are provided with five instances that you have to solve.
1)Formulate the problem as an integer programming problem
2)Implement the formulation in Java using CPLEX library
3)For each instance measure the running time as well as the optimal value
4)
